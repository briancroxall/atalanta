                        <lb/>Hereupon Latona had there the the most sumptuous temple next to Vulcan, cove

                        <lb/>moles and blemishes in her face, which must be taken away by art, namely
                        <lb/>by dealbation: Some <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice>doe</orig> make dealbations of Cerufe, Mercury Sublimate,
